# Moon-Calendar
This calendar is for the moon lovers out there. This calendar tells you what phase of the moon is going on and its illumination on the specified date. It is programmed using vanilla HTML, JS and CSS along with using the API from ipgeolocation. The backgroud was created with the help of Canva.
